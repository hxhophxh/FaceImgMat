# FaceImgMat - Product Overview

## Project Purpose
FaceImgMat (人脸图像匹配系统) is a high-performance face recognition and matching system built on InsightFace and FAISS. It provides intelligent face detection, identification, and matching capabilities for enterprise and security applications.

## Value Proposition
- **High-Speed Recognition**: Millisecond-level response with FAISS vector search (<50ms for 10K+ person database)
- **High Accuracy**: >99% accuracy with 70% similarity threshold
- **Offline Deployment**: Fully supports air-gapped environments with zero-dependency deployment options
- **Production Ready**: Includes complete deployment automation, security features, and monitoring

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Intelligent Face Recognition**: Upload photos to automatically identify and match persons in database
- **High-Speed Retrieval**: FAISS-powered vector search with millisecond response times
- **Similarity Ranking**: Top-K results sorted by similarity scores with visual confidence indicators
- **Person Management**: Batch import, query, and manage personnel information
- **Match History**: Automatic recording of all matching operations with audit trail
- **Modern UI**: Bootstrap 5 responsive design with intuitive user experience

### Deployment Options
- **Online Deployment**: Standard installation with internet connectivity (5-15 minutes)
- **Standard Offline**: Pre-packaged dependencies for Python environments without internet (~1.5GB, 2-5 minutes)
- **Super Offline**: Zero-dependency deployment including Python installer for completely fresh machines (10MB-2GB, 15-40 minutes)
